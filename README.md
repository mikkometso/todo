# TODO app

Small demo app that I created as an environment to study and learn more.

Lately have been trying to learn more about Docker and ci/cd pipelines so trying to get this app to run in AWS and deploy new version when something is pushed to `main`. ~If I get this work~ Got this to work and the app ~should~ can be found [here](http://todoapp-env-3.eba-d7kj8urj.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
